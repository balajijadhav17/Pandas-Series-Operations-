# Pandas Series Operations

This repository contains various **pandas Series** operations examples and related code. The series operations include tasks such as creating Series, handling missing values, filtering duplicates, and more. This folder serves as a resource for learning and applying pandas Series functionality in data manipulation and analysis.

## Contents

### **1. Series Creation**
Examples of creating pandas Series from different data sources, such as:
- Lists
- Dictionaries
- Arrays
- Other formats

### **2. Missing Data Handling**
Methods for dealing with missing data in a pandas Series, including:
- `fillna()`: Fill missing values with a constant, method, or interpolation.
- `dropna()`: Remove missing values from a Series.

### **3. Duplicates Handling**
Techniques for identifying and handling duplicate values in a Series, such as:
- `drop_duplicates()`: Remove duplicate values.
- Custom methods for filtering out or keeping specific duplicates.

### **4. Statistical Methods**
Usage of statistical methods available in pandas Series, including:
- `mean()`: Calculate the mean.
- `sum()`: Sum all values.
- `median()`: Find the median.
- Other statistical operations (e.g., `std()`, `min()`, `max()`).

### **5. Indexing and Slicing**
Techniques for selecting specific rows and columns from a pandas Series, such as:
- `loc[]`: Label-based indexing.
- `iloc[]`: Position-based indexing.
- Slicing and conditional selection.
